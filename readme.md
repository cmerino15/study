# How to Run the Study app

## Option 1.
### Create a study.exe executable

in shell terminal

```console
g++ study.cpp -o study
```

this will create an executable

run the executable `$ study.exe`

## Option 2.
### Create a generic a.exe exectuble

or just run  

```console
g++ study.cpp
```

in the terminal

then a a.exe file will be created

then just `$ a.exe` or `$ a` should work

> [!NOTE]
> argc is always 1 + args

##ToDo:

- [ ] Open chatgpt and bing ai
- [ ] Search cppreference
- [ ] Make the study app specific to a topic - perhaps just a language learning tool or just a cpp learning tool
